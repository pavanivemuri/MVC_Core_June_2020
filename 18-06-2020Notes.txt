- ActionResult specifies the actions to be performed by an controller action method. It defines functionality for action method which includes, returning a view, partial view, file, JSON, redirection etc..

-ActionResult controls the behavior of Action method.

-It encapsulates the result of any action method and performs functionality on behalf of action method.

-Action Result performs framework level operation.

-All Action Results in MVC 5 are derived from "ActionResult" base class, which is defined in "System.Web.Mvc"

ActionResult		Helper Method
==================================================
ViewResult		View()
PartialViewResult		PartialView()
FileResult			File()
JsonResult		Json()
RedirectResult		Redirect()
RedirectionToRouteResult	RedirectToAction()
ContentResult		Content()
JavaScriptResult		JavaScript()

		      HttpVerbs
- Every controller action method by default responds to "GET" request.
- HttpVerbs annotation [attribute] is used to defined the request type that an controller action method must respond to i.e GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- HttpVerbs is assigned to controller method by using "AcceptVerbs"

 Syntax:
	[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
		    (or)
	[HttpPost]


		      ViewResult
- ViewResult defines an action result that sends a View (Page) as response for client request.

- View() is an Helper method for ViewResult.

- ViewResult is derived for ViewResultBase, which is implementing "ActionResult" base.

- ViewResult is handled by using the objects of 
	a) IViewEngine
	b) IView

- IViewEngine
     * It have collection of ViewEngines installed for your
       application.
     * MVC by default configured with "ASPX & Razor" engines
     * MVC 5 be default uses Razor Engine and ASPX engine is disabled.
     * IViewEngine Object loads all ViewEngines that are supported by your application.

- IView
    * IView object finds the view required for controller action
      method.
    * It loads the view into ViewEngine
    * ViewEngine will process and render a HTML response
      to client. 

Note: ViewEngine dynamically renders HTML

- ViewResult - View()  looks for the View with same name as "ActionMethod" name in the following locations.

	            Index() 
	            Index.cshtml

- Where it looks for the View?
